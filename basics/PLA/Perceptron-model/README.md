# Perceptron Model
* This is the code for simple perceptron model. 

The perceptron was invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory , a perceptron is the simplest neural network possible: a computational model of a single neuron. A perceptron consists of one or more inputs, a processor, and a single output.

This repository contains the implementation of the perceptron model for classifiying linearly separable data.
The training data consists of,

## Inputs:

``
X = [X1 X2]
``

where, 

X<sub>1</sub> = Height of the person

X<sub>2</sub> = Weight of the person

## Outputs:

``
y = {1,-1}
``

where,

`y = 1` indicates **male**, and

`y = -1` indicates **female**
